I'm excited to announce that our team has been awarded a significant NSF grant to develop AI-enabled Atomic Force Microscopy systems. This $1,000,000 CPS Medium project will run from July 2024 to June 2027.

## Project Overview

The project "CPS: Medium: Artificial-intelligence-enabled Atomic Force Microscopy" aims to revolutionize how atomic force microscopy (AFM) systems operate by integrating advanced AI techniques. AFM is a critical tool in nanotechnology research, but current systems face limitations in speed, resolution, and adaptability.

Our interdisciplinary team includes:
- Prof. Juan Ren (PI)
- Prof. Adarsh Krishnamurthy (Co-PI)
- Prof. Anwesha Sarkar (Co-PI)
- Dr. Aditya Balu (Co-PI)

## Research Goals

The project will focus on:

1. Developing real-time AI controllers for adaptive AFM scanning
2. Creating physics-informed neural networks to enhance image reconstruction
3. Designing intelligent error correction and artifact removal systems
4. Building a comprehensive framework for AI-AFM integration

## Broader Impacts

This research will enhance the capabilities of AFM technology across multiple domains including materials science, biology, and semiconductor research. The improved scanning speed and resolution will enable new discoveries at the nanoscale.
