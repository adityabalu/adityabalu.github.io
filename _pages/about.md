I am a Data Scientist at Translational AI Center @ Iowa State University, specializing in deep learning and GPU algorithms for Computer Aided Engineering. My research interests span the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and computational mechanics.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on developing novel methodologies that enhance traditional engineering workflows through artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Key areas include:

- **Physics-informed Machine Learning**: Integrating domain knowledge with data-driven approaches
- **GPU Computing**: Acceleration of computational methods for engineering applications
- **Neural PDE Solvers**: Data-driven solutions for partial differential equations
- **Decentralized Learning**: Communication-efficient distributed machine learning
- **Scientific Machine Learning**: Applying ML to improve scientific computations

## Current Position

- **Data Scientist**, Translational AI Center (TrAC), Iowa State University

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Mechanical & Computer Engineering (Co-major)**, Iowa State University (2016-2020)
  - Dissertation: Deep Learning & GPU algorithms for Computer Aided Engineering
  - Advisors: Prof. Adarsh Krishnamurthy & Prof. Soumik Sarkar
- **B.E. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering**, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (2010-2014)

## Professional Experience

Prior to my current academic roles, I worked as:

- **Postdoctoral Research Associate**, Iowa State University (May 2020 - Dec 2021)
- **Machine Learning Co-op**, Ansys Inc., Pittsburgh, PA (July 2018 - Dec 2018)
- **Design Engineer - I**, FMC Technologies (now TechnipFMC), Hyderabad, India (July 2014 - July 2016)

I currently have an impressive research output with over 1500 citations and an h-index of 18. My work spans across machine learning for computational mechanics, deep learning for engineering applications, and GPU acceleration of scientific computing algorithms.
