I am Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Iowa State University. Prior to this, I finished my PhD under joint supervision of [Adarsh Krishnamurthy](https://web.me.iastate.edu/idealab/index.html) and [Soumik Sarkar](http://scslab.me.iastate.edu/). My research focuses on building computational tools for engineering applications. The goal of this research is to facilitate end-user engineers with better, faster and more robust tools, particularly for design.


The research can be summarized into three broad categories:
1. Deep learning for physics-driven design and manufacturing
2. GPU computing for geometric design
3. Geometry-aware computational simulation tools
